**A Simple Web Browser Compiled by Lua**

## Design
* Everything starts from the simple, removes a lot of useless functions, and strives to be simple and efficient.
* Simple and gorgeous with the Material Design style.

## Features
* Compiling with Lua is much smaller than Java, and the installation package is even less than 2 MB.
* Using the Webview kernel, loading the web page directly calls the system kernel, which is faster.

## Other Editions
* **Windows Edition:** Probably the smallest browser on the PC side, only 1 MB.
* **Independent Kernel Edition:** Ignore some system webview crashes, video supports full-screen playback.
